# React Frontend Challenge - Github User Search App

In this challenge I am supposed to build a simple React app to search for Github users and display their information using
the Github API.

It will consist of a simple search page and a user profile page with the option to check the users repos.

## Packages used:
### Create-react-app.
### React router dom.
### React icons.

## Instructions to run the project

### `npm install` in order to install all the packages and dependencies.
### `npm start` in your terminal starts the live server.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
